#Simple Simon
Simple Simon is a memory game where a color pattern is flashed and the player must repeat the sequence to continue to the next round. An additional color is added to the sequence each round and every five rounds the speed of the pattern is increased. I am a big fan of the Final Fantasy franchise and this project coincided with the release of Final Fantasy XV, so I gave the game a similar theme using images and sounds from the series. JavaScript was used to handle the flow and logic of the game, jQuery was used to manipulate and animate elements on the HTML page, and Bootstrap was used for design and mobile responsiveness.
